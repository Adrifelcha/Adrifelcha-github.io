	<h1>Hi there, I'm Adriana F. Ch√°vez!</h1>
	
	<h1>I'm a very enthusiastic undergrad Psychology student at the <em> National Autonomous University of Mexico </em> </h1>
	
	<h3><b>I can't decide which colors use for my website :C I wanted something full of life (like a  rainbow) but that doesn't look quite academic-ish</b></h3>
			
	<h3> I think my website looks a little awful. But, hey, I don't know how to properly dress myself (in terms of fashion or anything), so don't judge my missuse of the colors on this website </h3>
