<p> Ok, let's take a look at how things are going with my life...

<p> First, my phone got stolen yesterday. It was already too old to function correctly, and it crashed everytime it had to do about anything, but my whole life and dreams were on that little device, so yeah, it's kind of a big deal for me. </p>

<p> Most important, I'm way too far from having all the requisites fullfilled by the time that my dreamt phD program's deadline comes to life. So it seems like I' gonna have to wait for another whole year to get a chance to apply again </p>

<p> And yet, here I am, trying to confort myself by learning something new... Let's see how this ends </p>
