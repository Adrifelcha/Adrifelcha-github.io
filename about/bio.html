			<h3>I was born in México City back in 1993, on March 7th. Ever since, I've lived with my parents and my crazy little-sister, Angélica.</h3>
			
			<h3>I've always had a good memory, so I was one of the best students at school when I was little. Our educational system tends to give a lot of importance to the grades that students get on their exams, and since I could easily memorize the content of my notes, I always looked as if I had learned a lot more than now I think I did.</h3>
