		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		
<h3>My name is Adriana Felisa Chávez De la Peña, I'm an undergrad Psychology student at the National Autonomous University of México (UNAM), and if the Earth keeps spinning as it's meant to, I'm supposed to be getting my BA degree next February.</h3>

<h3>As a psychologist, I'm interested in the study of both: the general rules that control Behavior and the Cognitive processes behind them. </h3>
				
<h3> Since 2015, I've been an active member of Lab25 <a href="http://www.bouzaslab25.com" target="_blank"><i>(Visit our website here!)</i></a>, a happy place where a bunch of pretty interesting (and socially awkward) psychology students, as myself, are interested in the study of a wide variety of adaptative problems faced by every organism who's actions seek for an optimal behaviour. Our fields of interest cover from the most classic dilemmas on Psychophysics to the more abstract problem faced by those who study heuristics and decission making. As mixed-up as it may sound, we do a pretty good job making sense out of it, mostly thanks to the guidance of <b>Dr  Arturo Bouzas Riaño</b>, our mentor. </h3>
