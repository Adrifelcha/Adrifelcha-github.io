Our fields of interest cover from the most classic dilemmas on Psychophysics to the more abstract problem faced by those who study heuristics and decission making. As mixed-up as it may sound, we do a pretty good job making sense out of it, mostly thanks to the guidance of <b>Dr  Arturo Bouzas Riaño</b>, our mentor. </h3>

<h3>As well as being a researcher, my passion for Experimental Psychology is also reflected in a huge interest on the teaching part. As a member of Lab25, I've worked as a T.A. for several courses given by Dr Bouzas, and I've directed three vacational courses among two of my colleagues and best friends (<b>José Manuel Niño</b> and <b>Uriel O.
